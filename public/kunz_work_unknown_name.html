        We can first start by a simple triangle shape from which we've removed
        the bottom.
      </div>
      <div id="first-pyramid" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        Then, by rotating around the center of the canvas, we can duplicate this
        shape at every 90 degrees, creating a symmetric shape.
      </div>
      <div id="first-pyramid-square" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        Using this basis, we can then add lines between the two extremities.
      </div>
      <div id="first-pyramid-square-multlines" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        We can repeat the process with a different shape.
      </div>
      <div id="second-pyramid" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        With this shape, several lines align when rotating around the center
        point, creating different shapes in the process.
      </div>
      <div id="second-pyramid-square" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        By adding lines within the basic shape, we can create overlaps and
        moire-like patterns in the shape.
      </div>
      <div id="second-pyramid-square-multlines" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        We can repeat the same process with a slightly different shape in which
        the extremities go only halfway down the height.
      </div>
      <div id="third-pyramid" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        By applying the rotation, the diamond created is slightly bigger, but
        the boundaries of the shape are similar.
      </div>
      <div id="third-pyramid-square" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        When introducing more lines, the overlapping effect is even more
        intense.
      </div>
      <div id="third-pyramid-square-multlines" class="kunz-canvas"></div>
      <div class="description">
        Adding the initial red shape creates more intensity and fills the
        negative space inside the shape.
